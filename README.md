# Convolutional Neural Networks
Crack detection is important for the inspection and evaluation during the maintenance of concrete structures. However, conventional image-based methods need extract crack features using complex image preprocessing techniques, so it can lead to challenges when concrete surface contains various types of noise due to extensively varying real-world situations such as thin cracks, rough surface, shadows, etc.
